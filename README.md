Zombie.js
=========

If you're going to write an insanely fast, headless test tool, how can you not
call it Zombie?  Zombie it is.

Zombie.js is a lightweight framefork for testing client-side JavaScript code in
a simulated environment.  No browser required.

Zombie.js runs on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), so it's insanely fast.  It
uses [JSDOM](http://jsdom.org/) to simulate a brower, so it can't find
incompatibility issues in IE 7.0, but it can spot bugs in your code.

You don't have to, but I really recommend running Zombie.js with
[Vows](http://vowsjs.org/) , an outstanding BDD test framework for Node.js.
