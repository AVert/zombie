Version 0.6.1  2010-12-20

	Changed browser.cookies from getter to function that accepts cookie domain
	(host and port) and path, and returns wrapper to access specific cookie
	context.

	Fixed: browser now creates new window for each new document.

	Added window.JSON.

	178 tests.
	1.8 sec to complete.


Version 0.6.0  2010-12-20
	First release that I could use to test an existing project.

	Supports for navigation, filling and submitting forms, and selecting document
	content using Sizzle. Browser features include evaluating JavaScript (jQuery,
	Sammy.js), timers, XHR, cookies, local and session storage.

	Still very rough around the edges.

	175 tests.
	1.8 sec to complete.
